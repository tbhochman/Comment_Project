In the first semester, we covered the fundamentals of Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and dictionaries. In addition, we explored connections between math and computer science, including plotting, simulating the game of craps, and optimizing customer service at a bank.
I appreciate Kiwi’s energy this semester. While it is clear that Computer Science was perhaps not her preferred class choice, she still performed well throughout the semester. As such, Kiwi's problem set average was 80%, which indicates that she had a decent understanding of the majority of the topics covered this semester and that she was somewhat consistent about meeting deadlines. For her quiz average and final exam score, Kiwi got 74% and 75%, respectively, which demonstrated that she satisfactorily grasped the new content thoroughly and could often hand write algorithms without using outside resources.
In Kiwi's self reflection, she wrote: 
	Pie couldn't have cared less about this class
On the daily coding activities, Kiwi mostly worked collaboratively since she did not always pick up the material as easily as others. Often, she would seek help from a classmate when she got stuck. In terms of coming in for extra help, Kiwi occasionally came in for support, but I wish she would have done so more often as it may have improved her success in the class.
Kiwi’s group Bank Project grade was a 89%, which indicated that her effort, time management, and collaboration relating to larger group assignments were lacking. Kiwi also demonstrated a dearth of enthusiasm and dedication when participating in the Hackathons. These assignments allowed students to put forth as much effort as they wished to, and Kiwi generally chose to use these opportunities to rely on those around her instead of trying to advance her skills.
Overall, Kiwi seemed to generally enjoy herself in this class. Generally, she was upbeat as she typed away. I hope that Kiwi enjoyed her first semester of Comp Sci!
